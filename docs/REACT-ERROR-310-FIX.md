# Fixing Minified React Error #310 in Blog Posts

This document provides a comprehensive guide to diagnosing and fixing the "Minified React error #310" occurring when viewing blog posts on mobile devices.

## Summary of the Issue

The error occurs due to a hydration mismatch between server-rendered markup and client-side rendering. Specifically, there's a property naming inconsistency between the API response data (snake_case: `cover_image`, `published_at`) and the React component props (camelCase: `coverImage`, `publishedAt`).

## Implemented Fixes

We've implemented several layers of protection against this error:

1. **Enhanced Error Boundaries**:
   - Added a `SafeBlogPostContent` wrapper component specifically for blog content
   - Improved error fallbacks with helpful user messaging
   - Added nested error boundaries for granular recovery

2. **Data Normalization**:
   - Updated the `BlogService.ts` to include both camelCase and snake_case properties
   - Added defensive data normalization in the `BlogPost` component
   - Updated TypeScript types to include both property naming conventions

3. **Debugging Tools**:
   - Created a `debug-blog-error.js` utility for detailed error logging
   - Added `blog-error-detector.ts` for automatic detection of common issues
   - Created a development debugging script at `dev-scripts/debug-blog-errors.js`

## How to Test the Fix

To verify the fix is working:

1. Run the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to a blog post on a mobile device or using responsive design mode in DevTools

3. The blog post should load without the "Something went wrong" error

## Debugging Tools

For development and testing:

### Debug Mode Script

Run the debugging script to get detailed error output:

```
./dev-scripts/debug-blog-errors.js
```

This will:
- Start the dev server with React error stack traces enabled
- Open a debug assistant in your browser
- Provide tools to analyze specific blog post errors

### Manual Debugging

For specific blog post issues:

1. Open the browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for React error messages
4. Check the Network tab to see the API response format
5. Compare response data with the expected props in `BlogPostContent.tsx`

## Understanding the Fix

### Property Naming Consistency

The main issue was the property naming mismatch:

```javascript
// API returns:
{
  "cover_image": "...",
  "published_at": "..."
}

// But component expects:
{
  coverImage: "...",
  publishedAt: "..."
}
```

The fix ensures both naming conventions are supported:

```typescript
// In src/types/blog/index.ts:
export type BlogPost = {
  // ...
  coverImage: string;
  publishedAt: string | null;
  
  // Added for compatibility:
  cover_image?: string;
  published_at?: string | null;
}
```

### Defensive Data Handling

Added thorough data validation:

```javascript
// In BlogPost.tsx:
const safePost = {
  ...normalizedPost,
  // Ensure required props
  id: normalizedPost.id || `fallback-${Date.now()}`,
  title: normalizedPost.title || 'Untitled Post',
  
  // Handle common mismatches
  coverImage: normalizedPost.coverImage || (normalizedPost as any).cover_image || '',
  publishedAt: normalizedPost.publishedAt || (normalizedPost as any).published_at || null,
  
  // Ensure nested objects
  category: normalizedPost.category || { 
    id: 'default', 
    name: 'Uncategorized', 
    slug: 'uncategorized' 
  }
  // ...
};
```

### Error Boundaries

Added proper error boundaries with fallbacks:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary 
  fallback={<UserFriendlyErrorMessage />}
  onError={handleError}
>
  <SafeBlogPostContent post={safePost} relatedPosts={relatedPosts} />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

## Future Considerations

1. **API Consistency**: Standardize on either camelCase or snake_case across the entire API

2. **Data Transformers**: Implement a consistent transformation layer between API responses and component props

3. **Schema Validation**: Add runtime schema validation for API responses using libraries like Zod, Yup, or io-ts

4. **Automated Testing**: Add E2E tests specifically for blog post rendering

## Need Additional Help?

If the issue persists or you encounter new errors:

1. Run the debug script: `./dev-scripts/debug-blog-errors.js`
2. Check the console for detailed error messages
3. Analyze API responses and component props for discrepancies
4. Use the error boundary fallbacks to identify which component is failing
