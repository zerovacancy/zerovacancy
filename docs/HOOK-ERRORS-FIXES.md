# React Hook Errors Fix Summary

## The Problem

We encountered React hook errors in the application with messages like:

```
Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
```

And:

```
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
```

This was likely caused by having multiple versions of React in the application.

## The Fix

We've applied a simpler, more maintainable approach to fix the React hook errors:

1. **Updated package.json with React resolutions**:
   - Added explicit resolutions for React, React DOM, and their submodules
   - This forces all dependencies to use the same React version (18.3.1)

2. **Removed the complex React singleton approach**:
   - Removed the React singleton files and plugin
   - Simplified the main.tsx file

3. **Applied proper dependency management**:
   - Used npm dedupe to ensure React dependencies are properly deduplicated
   - Configured overrides to handle problematic packages

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Visit the blog editor and verify it loads properly
2. Check the console for any React-related errors
3. Try editing and saving a blog post

## If Issues Persist

If you still encounter React hook errors:

1. Run `npm ls react` to check for duplicate React instances
2. Clear your browser cache completely
3. Try running `npm clean-install` to reinstall all dependencies
4. Confirm that Vite is properly handling React optimization

## Technical Details

The fix focuses on dependency management rather than runtime code manipulation:

```json
"resolutions": {
  "react": "18.3.1",
  "react-dom": "18.3.1",
  "react/jsx-runtime": "18.3.1",
  "react/jsx-dev-runtime": "18.3.1",
  "react-dom/client": "18.3.1"
}
```

This approach ensures that a single version of React is used throughout the application, which is the core requirement for React hooks to work properly.
