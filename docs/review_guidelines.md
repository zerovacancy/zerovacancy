# Code Review Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for reviewing code in terms of quality, performance, security, and maintainability. Use these guidelines when reviewing code changes to ensure consistent, high-quality feedback.

## Code Quality

When reviewing code quality, consider the following:

### Correctness
- Does the code correctly implement the intended functionality?
- Are there any logical errors or edge cases not handled?
- Do unit tests verify the expected behavior?
- Are there any off-by-one errors or incorrect boundary conditions?

### Readability
- Is the code easy to read and understand?
- Are variable and function names descriptive and consistent?
- Is the code well-formatted and consistently styled?
- Are complex operations explained with comments?

**Example of poor readability:**
```
function x(a,b) {
  let c = 0;
  for(let i=0;i<a.length;i++) {
    if(a[i]>b) c += a[i];
  }
  return c;
}
```

**Improved readability:**
```
function sumValuesGreaterThan(values, threshold) {
  let sum = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    if (values[i] > threshold) {
      sum += values[i];
    }
  }
  
  return sum;
}
```

### Naming Conventions
- Are variables, functions, and classes named clearly and consistently?
- Do names follow project conventions?
- Are abbreviations avoided unless they're universally understood?
- Do names reveal intent and purpose?

### Error Handling
- Is error handling comprehensive and appropriate?
- Are errors propagated correctly?
- Are error messages clear and helpful?
- Are resources properly released in error cases?

### Edge Cases
- Are edge cases handled properly?
- Is input validation thorough?
- Is the code resilient to unexpected inputs?
- Are boundary conditions tested?

### Code Duplication
- Is there any unnecessary code duplication?
- Could shared functionality be extracted into helper functions?
- Are there opportunities to use existing libraries or utilities?

### Complexity
- Is the code unnecessarily complex?
- Could complex sections be simplified or broken down?
- Are there too many nested conditions or loops?
- Would a different algorithm or data structure simplify the code?

## Performance

When reviewing code for performance, consider the following:

### Algorithmic Efficiency
- Are the algorithms and data structures appropriate for the task?
- What is the time and space complexity of the code?
- Could a more efficient algorithm be used?
- Are there any unnecessary computations or iterations?

**Example of inefficient code:**
```
// O(nÂ²) approach to find duplicates
function hasDuplicates(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j++) {
      if (i !== j && array[i] === array[j]) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

**More efficient approach:**
```
// O(n) approach using a Set
function hasDuplicates(array) {
  const seen = new Set();
  for (const item of array) {
    if (seen.has(item)) {
      return true;
    }
    seen.add(item);
  }
  return false;
}
```

### Resource Usage
- Does the code use memory, CPU, and other resources efficiently?
- Are there any memory leaks?
- Are resources properly released when no longer needed?
- Is the code optimized for the target environment?

### Loops and Iterations
- Are loops and iterations optimized?
- Could any loops be combined or eliminated?
- Are there any unnecessary iterations?
- Is work being repeated unnecessarily?

### Database Queries
- Are database queries optimized?
- Are indexes used effectively?
- Are queries batched where appropriate?
- Is the database connection pool managed properly?

### Network Requests
- Are network requests minimized and optimized?
- Is data cached appropriately?
- Are requests batched where possible?
- Is proper error handling in place for network failures?

### Caching
- Is caching used appropriately where beneficial?

- Are cache sizes appropriate for the expected load?
- Is the caching layer properly abstracted?

### Asynchronous Operations
- Are operations that could block the main thread handled asynchronously?
- Is concurrency managed properly?
- Are promises or async/await used correctly?
- Are there any potential race conditions?

### Lazy Loading
- Is lazy loading used where appropriate?
- Are heavy resources loaded only when needed?
- Is there a good balance between initial load time and responsiveness?

## Security

When reviewing code for security, consider the following:

### Input Validation
- Is all user input properly validated?
- Is input sanitized before use?
- Are there any potential injection vulnerabilities?
- Is validation consistent across the application?

**Example of vulnerable code:**
```
// SQL injection vulnerability
function getUserData(userId) {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
  return database.execute(query);
}
```

**Secure approach:**
```
// Using parameterized queries
function getUserData(userId) {
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?`;
  return database.execute(query, [userId]);
}
```
