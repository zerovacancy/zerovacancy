# Site-Wide CLS Analysis

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) issues across the entire ZeroVacancy site. The analysis was performed using automated testing tools to identify components and pages with the most significant layout stability issues.

## Testing Methodology

All tests were conducted using the following methodology:

1. **Tools**: Automated Puppeteer-based script with enhanced component tracking
2. **Devices**: Testing across 8 device sizes (from Mobile-Tiny to Desktop-Large)
3. **Interaction Types**: Various interactions including scrolling, resizing, and clicking
4. **Component Tracking**: Detailed component-level CLS tracking for precise issue identification

## Component Analysis

The following components were found to have CLS issues:

| Component | Average CLS Score | Priority | Affected Pages |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| [component name] | [score] | [high/medium/low] | [pages] |

## Page Analysis

The following pages were found to have CLS issues:

| Page | Average CLS Score | Priority | Primary Issue Components |
|------|-------------------|----------|--------------------------|
| [page name] | [score] | [high/medium/low] | [components] |

## Device-Specific Issues

The following device-specific issues were identified:

| Device | Components with Issues | Specific Problems |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| [device] | [components] | [description] |

## Root Causes

Common root causes of CLS issues identified across the site:

1. **[Cause 1]**: Description of the issue
2. **[Cause 2]**: Description of the issue
3. **[Cause 3]**: Description of the issue

## Optimization Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following optimization recommendations are prioritized:

### High Priority

1. **[Component/Page]**: 
   - Issue: [description]
   - Recommendation: [solution]
   - Expected impact: [impact]

### Medium Priority

1. **[Component/Page]**: 
   - Issue: [description]
   - Recommendation: [solution]
   - Expected impact: [impact]

### Low Priority

1. **[Component/Page]**: 
   - Issue: [description]
   - Recommendation: [solution]
   - Expected impact: [impact]

## Implementation Plan

1. Address high-priority issues first, starting with:
   - [ ] [Task 1]
   - [ ] [Task 2]
   - [ ] [Task 3]

2. Then address medium-priority issues:
   - [ ] [Task 1]
   - [ ] [Task 2]
   - [ ] [Task 3]

3. Finally address low-priority issues:
   - [ ] [Task 1]
   - [ ] [Task 2]
   - [ ] [Task 3]

## Future Monitoring

To ensure CLS issues don't recur:

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated CLS testing as part of CI/CD pipeline
2. **Performance Budgets**: Set CLS budgets per component
3. **Regression Testing**: Regular CLS testing across the site
4. **Component Reviews**: CLS impact review for new components
