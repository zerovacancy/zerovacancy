# Core Performance Improvements

This document outlines the core performance improvements implemented in the ZeroVacancy website to improve Core Web Vitals and overall user experience.

## Implemented Improvements

### 1. Layout Shift Prevention (`src/utils/layout-shift-prevention.ts`)

- Prevents Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) by stabilizing elements during page load
- Includes techniques for:
  - Reserving space for images before they load
  - Stabilizing dynamic height elements
  - Ensuring fixed position elements don't cause layout shifts
  - Special handling for fixed-bottom elements to avoid mobile viewport issues

### 2. Font Loading Optimization (`src/utils/font-loading.js`)

- Implements size-adjusted system font fallbacks to prevent layout shifts during font loading
- Uses font-display properties for optimal font rendering
- Preloads critical fonts
- Supports both modern and legacy browsers
- Mobile-specific optimizations for faster perceived performance

### 3. Image Optimization (`src/utils/image-optimization.ts`)

- Automatically detects and uses modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) when supported
- Implements responsive image techniques
- Adds proper width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts
- Uses lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- Provides adaptive image serving based on network and device capabilities

### 4. Critical CSS Extraction (`scripts/critical-css.js`)

- Extracts and inlines critical CSS for above-the-fold content
- Improves First Contentful Paint by reducing render-blocking resources
- Defers loading of non-critical CSS
- Includes font loading optimizations directly in critical CSS

### 5. Web Vitals Monitoring (`src/utils/web-vitals.ts`)

- Adds real-time monitoring of Core Web Vitals metrics
- Provides development-time visual feedback
- Supports production monitoring with sampling rate controls
- Implements best practices for performance metric collection

### 6. Flash of Unstyled Content Prevention (`src/components/FOUCPrevention.tsx`)

- Prevents flash of unstyled content during page load
- Special handling for problematic images (heroparallax)
- Progressive enhancement approach for content display

### 7. CriticalPreload Component (`src/components/CriticalPreload.tsx`)

- Preloads critical resources for faster initial render
- Implements resource prioritization
- Manages render-blocking resources efficiently

## Impact on Core Web Vitals

These improvements directly target the three Core Web Vitals metrics:

1. **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**
   - Critical CSS inlining speeds up rendering of main content
   - Font preloading ensures text is displayed quickly
   - Image optimization reduces load time for hero images

2. **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**
   - Layout shift prevention ensures stable UI during loading
   - Size-adjusted font fallbacks prevent text movement
   - Image dimension reservation prevents content jumps

3. **First Input Delay (FID)/Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**
   - JavaScript optimization reduces main thread blocking
   - Deferred loading of non-critical resources
   - Throttled event handlers for smoother interactions

## Next Steps

While these core improvements provide significant performance gains, additional optimizations can be implemented:

1. Implement code splitting for JavaScript bundles
2. Add resource hints (preconnect, prefetch) for critical third-party resources
3. Implement service worker caching for frequently accessed assets
4. Explore server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for key pages
5. Implement HTTP/2 server push for critical assets

## Usage Instructions

These performance improvements are designed to work without requiring changes to existing components. Simply import and use the provided utilities where needed:

```tsx
// In your App.tsx or equivalent main component:
import { initializeLayoutStabilization } from '@/utils/layout-shift-prevention';
import { optimizeFontLoading } from '@/utils/font-loading';
import { initImageOptimization } from '@/utils/image-optimization';
import { reportWebVitals } from '@/utils/web-vitals';

// Initialize optimizations
useEffect(() => {
  initializeLayoutStabilization();
  optimizeFontLoading();
  initImageOptimization();
  reportWebVitals();
}, []);
```

## Measuring Results

To measure the impact of these improvements:

1. Use Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
2. Check PageSpeed Insights scores
3. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
4. Use the built-in Web Vitals monitoring in development
