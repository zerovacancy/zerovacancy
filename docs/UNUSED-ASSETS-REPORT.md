# Unused Assets Report

## Summary of Findings

After a thorough audit of the codebase, we have identified several categories of unused assets that are affecting performance and unnecessarily increasing the bundle size.

### 1. Heroparallax Images (Resolved)

✅ **Status**: Moved to `/public/archived-assets/heroparallax/`

These images were previously used in the old `ParallaxHero` component but are no longer referenced in the current codebase. We have already moved them to an archived directory, but they are still being included in the build output.

**Size Impact**: ~15MB of unnecessary assets in the build

### 2. Large Unused Media Files in Creator Content

⚠️ **Status**: Still active in the codebase

Several large media files in the `public/creatorcontent/` directory appear to be unused in the codebase:

1. `public/creatorcontent/emily-johnson/work-2.jpg` (5.28MB)
2. `public/creatorcontent/emily-johnson/work-3.jpg` (1.14MB)
3. `public/creatorcontent/jane-cooper/work-1.jpg` (3.21MB)
4. `public/creatorcontent/jane-cooper/work-2.jpg` (1.05MB)
5. `public/creatorcontent/jane-cooper/work-3.jpg` (3.63MB)
6. `public/creatorcontent/michael-brown/work-1.jpg` (4.39MB)
7. `public/creatorcontent/michael-brown/work-2.jpg` (1.83MB)
8. `public/creatorcontent/michael-brown/work-3.jpg` (9.27MB)

**Size Impact**: ~30MB of unused assets in the build

### 3. Large Video Files

⚠️ **Status**: Still active in the codebase

A large .mov file is present but not referenced:
- `public/michaelprofile.mov` (3.94MB)

**Size Impact**: ~4MB of unused assets

## Total Impact

- **Total Unused Asset Size**: ~49MB
- **Current Status**: ~15MB moved to archived directory, ~34MB still active

## Root Causes

1. **Build Configuration**: The current Vite configuration copies all files from `/public` to the build directory without filtering out unused assets.

2. **Asset Management**: There is no automated process to detect and handle unused assets during the build process.

3. **Historical Files**: The codebase contains placeholder and demo content that was used during development but is not needed in production.

## Recommendations

### 1. Build Process Updates

- Update the Vite config to exclude the `/archived-assets/` directory from the build process
- Add a script to the build pipeline that automatically checks for unused assets

### 2. Immediate Actions

1. **Clean Up Creator Content**:
   - Move unused creator content files to `/public/archived-assets/creatorcontent/`
   - Replace large images with optimized, smaller versions
   - Convert original JPGs to WebP format to reduce size by 70-80%

2. **Optimize Video Assets**:
   - Move `michaelprofile.mov` to archived assets directory
   - If needed, create an optimized compressed MP4 or WebM version

3. **Build Configuration**:
   - Add an exclusion pattern for `archived-assets` in the Vite configuration:
   ```javascript
   build: {
     // Other config...
     rollupOptions: {
       input: {
         main: './index.html',
       },
       output: {
         // Other output config...
       },
     },
     emptyOutDir: true,
     // Exclude archived assets from build
     copyPublicDir: true,
     publicDir: {
       exclude: ['**/archived-assets/**'],
     },
   },
   ```

### 3. Long-term Strategy

1. **Asset Optimization Pipeline**:
   - Implement automated WebP conversion for all images
   - Add image size and quality optimization to the build process
   - Implement lazy loading for all non-critical images

2. **Regular Asset Audits**:
   - Add the asset audit script to the CI/CD pipeline
   - Run monthly audits to catch and clean up unused assets

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update the README with clear guidelines for adding new assets
   - Document the purpose and usage of image directories in the codebase

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1 - Immediate Cleanup**
   - Move unused creator content to archived directory
   - Exclude archived assets from build

2. **Phase 2 - Build Process Optimization**
   - Update Vite configuration
   - Add automated WebP conversion

3. **Phase 3 - Asset Management System**
   - Implement a more structured asset management system
   - Add automated checks to the CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

Cleaning up unused assets represents a significant opportunity to improve site performance, reduce bandwidth costs, and improve developer experience. The ~49MB of unused assets identified could be significantly reduced or better organized, improving load times and reducing hosting costs.
