# Vercel Static Assets Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified

The issue with "Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'text/html'" was caused by incorrect routing configuration in `vercel.json`. 

The specific problems were:

1. The rewrite rule `{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }` was capturing ALL requests, including those for static assets like JavaScript files.

2. When a browser requested a JS file, Vercel was sending the HTML content of index.html instead of the actual JS file, resulting in the MIME type mismatch.

3. The environment config script was using CommonJS syntax (`require`) in a project configured as ESM (`"type": "module"` in package.json).

## Solution Implemented

1. **Updated vercel.json with proper route order**:
   - Added explicit routes for static assets to be served directly
   - Used a better pattern matching approach with file extensions
   - Made the catch-all SPA route the last rule to process

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/assets/(.*)", "destination": "/assets/$1" },
    { "source": "/(.*\\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp|svg|ico|json|woff|woff2|ttf|otf|mp4|webm|ogg|mp3|wav|pdf|avif|wasm))", "destination": "/$1" },
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

2. **Fixed the environment config script**:
   - Renamed from `.js` to `.mjs` to indicate it's an ES module
   - Updated the code to use ES module imports instead of CommonJS require
   - Updated the `package.json` build script to use the new file name

## How This Fixes the Issue

The key to the fix is the order and specificity of the rewrite rules:

1. First rule: Explicitly handle `/assets/...` paths by serving the actual file
2. Second rule: Explicitly handle any path ending with a known static file extension
3. Last rule: Send all other routes to index.html for SPA routing

This ensures that:
- JavaScript files are served as JavaScript with the correct MIME type
- CSS files are served as CSS
- Image files are served as images
- All other routes still work for the SPA navigation

## Testing the Fix

After deploying this change to Vercel:
1. Check browser DevTools Network tab to verify JS files have `application/javascript` MIME type
2. Confirm no MIME type errors in the console
3. Verify the application loads correctly

## Additional Benefits

1. Better caching through proper Content-Type headers
2. Improved performance by avoiding unnecessary rewriting
3. More predictable behavior for static assets and client-side routing
