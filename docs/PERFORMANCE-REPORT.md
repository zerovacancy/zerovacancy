# Performance Optimization Report

## Improvements Made

### 1. Image Optimization
- Optimized 7 largest images on the site (35.08MB → 1.07MB, 97% reduction)
- Converted JPG/PNG to WebP format
- Resized images to appropriate dimensions
- Largest savings:
  - michael-brown/work-3.jpg: 9.27MB → 0.04MB (99.6% reduction)
  - og-image-new.png: 7.84MB → 0.08MB (99% reduction)

### 2. Resource Loading Optimization
- Deferred non-critical JavaScript loading
- Prioritized main application bundle
- Deferred third-party scripts until after page load

### 3. Accessibility Improvements
- Enabled viewport scaling (removed user-scalable=no)
- Updated page title to match OG title for consistency

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Replace Image References in Components**
   - Update components to use the newly created WebP images
   - Add proper width/height attributes to prevent layout shifts

2. **Create a Dedicated Image Component**
   - Implement the new `OptimizedImage` component in key places
   - Add WebP support with fallbacks to all images
   - Enable lazy loading for below-the-fold images

3. **Implement Additional WebP Images**
   - Continue converting remaining large images (run quick-optimize.mjs on additional files)
   - Focus on hero parallax and creator content images

4. **CSS Optimization**
   - Remove unused CSS
   - Optimize critical CSS path
   - Defer non-critical CSS loading

5. **JavaScript Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Reduce JavaScript bundle size
   - Remove unused code

## Key Performance Metrics to Monitor

- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Should be under 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): Should be under 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Should be under 0.1
- Total Blocking Time (TBT): Should be minimized

## How to Run the Optimizations

```bash
# Optimize more images
node quick-optimize.mjs

# Run a full build with optimizations
npm run build
```
