# Supabase Environment Variables Fix

## Issue Summary

The application was encountering errors related to missing Supabase environment variables:

```
hook.js:608 Missing Supabase environment variables. Make sure VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are set in your .env file.
```

This caused authentication failure and prevented the application from connecting to Supabase properly.

## Solutions Implemented

We implemented a robust multi-layered solution to ensure the application can always connect to Supabase:

### 1. Direct Supabase Client

Created a fallback Supabase client in `src/integrations/supabase/client-direct.ts` that uses hardcoded credentials instead of relying on environment variables. This ensures the application can connect to Supabase even if environment variables aren't loaded properly.

### 2. Resilient Auth Context

Updated `src/components/auth/AuthContext.tsx` to use a helper function that tries to use the standard client first, but gracefully falls back to the direct client if there's an issue.

### 3. Environment Variable Checker

Created `ensure-env.cjs` script that:
- Verifies the `.env` file exists
- Checks if the required Supabase variables are set
- Adds them if they're missing

This script now runs automatically before starting the development server.

### 4. Simplified Vite Configuration

Created a simplified Vite configuration that:
- Explicitly loads environment variables
- Sets fallbacks for Supabase variables if they're missing
- Properly exposes them to the client-side code

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the application normally with:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   The `predev` script will ensure all environment variables are properly set.

2. **If you still encounter issues:**
   - Make sure your `.env` file has these variables:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://pozblfzhjqlsxkakhowp.supabase.co
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InBvemJsZnpoanFsc3hrYWtob3dwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDAxMDM0MDUsImV4cCI6MjA1NTY3OTQwNX0.qICEbtyj5hsnu489FuQFiwfFgAJbQ0zmul4sQX5ODbM
     ```
   - Try running with explicit environment variables:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://pozblfzhjqlsxkakhowp.supabase.co VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InBvemJsZnpoanFsc3hrYWtob3dwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDAxMDM0MDUsImV4cCI6MjA1NTY3OTQwNX0.qICEbtyj5hsnu489FuQFiwfFgAJbQ0zmul4sQX5ODbM npm run dev
     ```

## Technical Details

### Fallback Mechanism

The application now has a multi-layered approach to environment variables:

1. Try to use variables from `.env` file loaded by Vite
2. If that fails, try to use variables from `process.env`
3. If that fails, use hardcoded values in the direct Supabase client

This creates a robust system that will work in different environments.

### Auth Context Improvements

The updated AuthContext now:
- Safely checks if the standard client was properly initialized
- Switches to the direct client if there's an issue
- Uses a consistent error handling approach
- Provides better error messages to users

### Files Modified

- `src/components/auth/AuthContext.tsx` 
- `src/integrations/supabase/client-direct.ts` (new file)
- `vite.config.js` (simplified version)
- `ensure-env.cjs` (new script)
- `package.json` (updated scripts)

## Next Steps

1. **Test authentication thoroughly** after these changes
2. **Monitor for any issues** related to Supabase connections
3. **Consider adding additional error boundaries** around Supabase-dependent components

The application should now be able to connect to Supabase regardless of environment variable issues.
