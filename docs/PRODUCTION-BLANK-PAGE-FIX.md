# Production Blank Page Fix

## Problem Analysis

After implementing our previous fixes and checking the production logs, we identified two key issues:

1. **Environment Variable Loading:** The error `hook.js:608 Missing Supabase environment variables` indicates that the environment variables aren't being properly loaded in production.

2. **JavaScript Loading Issue:** The error `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` indicates that a JavaScript file is receiving HTML content instead, which is likely due to routing issues.

## Comprehensive Solution Implemented

We've implemented a multi-layered approach to fix these issues:

### 1. Runtime Environment Variable Handling

- Created `/public/env-config.js` to provide runtime access to environment variables
- Added script tag to `index.html` to load environment variables before the app
- Defined `window.env` interface in TypeScript definitions
- Added Vite plugin to inject environment variables during build time

### 2. Enhanced Supabase Client

- Created new `client-runtime.ts` that checks multiple sources for credentials:
  1. First checks `window.env` (runtime variables)
  2. Then checks `import.meta.env` (build-time variables)
  3. Falls back to hardcoded values as a last resort

### 3. Updated AuthContext

- Modified the `getClient()` function to first try the runtime client
- Added additional fallback layers for more robustness

### 4. Fixed Vercel Configuration

- Improved `vercel.json` with proper routing and caching rules
- Removed environment variables from vercel.json (they should be set in the Vercel dashboard)
- Added proper framework and build configuration

### 5. Custom Vercel Build Process

- Created `vercel-build.js` script that runs before the build
- Generates runtime environment configuration files
- Added `vercel-build` script to package.json

## Key Files Modified

1. `/src/integrations/supabase/client-runtime.ts` - New runtime-safe Supabase client
2. `/public/env-config.js` - Runtime environment variables
3. `/vite-env-injector.js` - Injects environment variables at build time
4. `/vite.config.js` - Updated with new plugin
5. `/index.html` - Added env-config.js script tag
6. `/vercel.json` - Improved configuration
7. `/vercel-build.js` - Custom build script for Vercel
8. `/src/components/auth/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated client selection logic
9. `/src/types/window.d.ts` - Added TypeScript definitions for window.env

## Action Required

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Navigate to "Environment Variables"
   - Add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with their values

2. **Deploy Using the Vercel Build Command**
   - The deployment should use `npm run vercel-build` command
   - This is configured in vercel.json

## Testing the Fix

After deploying, the application should load properly without showing a blank page. If there are still issues, the error logging we've added will provide much more detailed information in the browser console.

## Future Improvements

1. Add a visual indicator when using fallback credentials
2. Add more comprehensive error boundaries throughout the application
3. Create a health-check endpoint to verify environment variables are working

This fix is robust because it provides multiple layers of fallbacks, ensuring that even if one approach fails, the application can still function properly.
