# Performance Optimization Summary

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented to improve Core Web Vitals and overall user experience for the ZeroVacancy website.

## Core Improvements Implemented

### 1. Layout Shift Prevention System

- Created a comprehensive layout shift prevention utility (`src/utils/layout-shift-prevention.ts`)
- Implemented techniques to stabilize elements during page load
- Added automated space reservation for images before they load
- Introduced special handling for fixed position elements
- Implemented containment strategies for dynamic content

### 2. Font Loading Optimizations

- Created font loading optimization utilities (`src/utils/font-loading.js`)
- Implemented size-adjusted system font fallbacks to prevent layout shifts
- Added proper font-loading stages with appropriate font-display properties
- Prioritized critical fonts with preloading
- Added mobile-specific font optimizations to reduce payload

### 3. Image Optimization Strategies

- Developed image optimization utilities (`src/utils/image-optimization.ts`)
- Added support for modern image formats (WebP, AVIF) with appropriate fallbacks
- Implemented responsive image techniques with proper width/height attributes
- Added lazy loading for below-the-fold images to improve initial load time
- Created an optimized image component that applies best practices automatically

### 4. Critical CSS Extraction

- Created a critical CSS extraction script (`scripts/critical-css.js`)
- Implemented inline critical styles for above-the-fold content
- Added deferred loading for non-critical CSS
- Included font loading optimizations in critical CSS
- Reduced render-blocking resources to improve First Contentful Paint

### 5. Web Vitals Monitoring

- Added real-time Core Web Vitals monitoring (`src/utils/web-vitals.ts`)
- Created development-time visual feedback for performance metrics
- Implemented production monitoring with sampling rate controls
- Added proper metric reporting with thresholds based on Google's standards
- Integrated with the application lifecycle for accurate measurement

### 6. Flash of Unstyled Content Prevention

- Enhanced FOUC prevention (`src/components/FOUCPrevention.tsx`)
- Added special handling for problematic hero images
- Implemented progressive enhancement for content display
- Created elegant content loading transitions
- Fixed heroparallax image flash issues

### 7. Performance Optimization Components

- Created and enhanced components for performance:
  - `CriticalPreload.tsx`: Preloads critical resources
  - `FontLoader.tsx`: Handles optimized font loading
  - Integrated these into the application flow

## New Scripts and Tools

Added the following scripts to package.json to streamline performance optimization:

```json
"build:perf": "vite build && npm run extract-critical-css",
"extract-critical-css": "node scripts/critical-css.js",
"analyze-web-vitals": "vite preview --port 8080 & sleep 2 && open http://localhost:8080?debug=vitals",
"perf-build": "npm run optimize-images && npm run build:perf",
"perf-test": "npm run perf-build && npm run analyze-web-vitals",
"perf-full": "npm run asset-cleanup && npm run perf-images && npm run perf-build"
```

## Impact Analysis

These improvements target Core Web Vitals in the following ways:

### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Critical CSS inlining speeds up initial render
- Font preloading ensures text is displayed quickly
- Image optimization reduces load times

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Layout shift prevention ensures UI stability
- Size-adjusted font fallbacks prevent text movement
- Image dimension reservation prevents content jumps

### First Input Delay (FID)/Interaction to Next Paint (INP)
- JavaScript optimization reduces main thread blocking
- Deferred loading of non-critical resources
- Throttled event handlers for smoother interactions

## Usage Instructions

To test these optimizations:

1. Run the full performance optimization:
   ```
   npm run perf-full
   ```

2. Test the optimized build:
   ```
   npm run perf-test
   ```

This will build the application with all optimizations and open it in the browser with Web Vitals monitoring enabled.

## Next Steps

The following additional optimizations could be implemented:

1. Implement code splitting and tree shaking for JavaScript files
2. Add HTTP/2 server push or resource hints for critical assets
3. Implement service worker caching strategies
4. Consider server-side rendering for key pages
5. Further optimize third-party script loading
